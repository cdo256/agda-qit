## Notes from Meeting

### Choice Principles and Type Theory

* **Intensional choice in Setoid implies countable choice.**
  If we assume a form of choice at the level of setoids, this already yields countable choice.

* **How can we add choice to type theory while preserving canonicity?**
  Canonicity is a *syntactic* property: every closed term of type ℕ reduces to a numeral. Adding choice principles risks breaking this.

* **Initial algebra in Setoid implies initiality in Set.**
  If we construct an initial algebra semantics in setoids, this may transfer to ordinary sets under suitable conditions.

* **Intensional choice vs WISC.**
  There seems to be a relationship between intensional choice principles and WISC. Is WISC a form of intensional choice?

### Forms of Choice

* **Representation choice** — choosing representatives from equivalence classes.

* **Set-level choice** — classical choice over sets.

* **Projectivity principle:**
  Surjections give choice (every surjection has a section). This is a strong form of choice.

---

### Obstructions to Constructing QITs

* **Lumsdaine–Shulman result (Cor. 9.2):**

  > If it is consistent with ZFC that there are arbitrarily large strongly compact cardinals, then ZF does not prove that the higher inductive type F exists in Set.
  > Since Set models type theory with pushouts and natural numbers, under this assumption F cannot be constructed from pushouts and the natural numbers.

  **Implication:**
  We cannot, in general, reduce all QITs to quotients (or pushouts + ℕ). Some require strictly stronger principles.

---

### Toward a Better Form of QIT Construction

* We want a **neater formulation of QITs** that clarifies exactly where choice is required.

* **Main question:** What is the *constructive alternative* to WISC?
  Could it be something like assuming a **regular cardinal** or a bounded size condition?

---

### Posets and W-Types

* Idea:
  Take a **family of posets**, form a new poset containing all of them, and take a **supremum**.

* Define **W-types over a poset** as fixed points of a colimit construction.

This suggests a generalization of W-types indexed by a size/ordinal structure.

---

### Categorified Containers

* Ordinary containers: morphisms are natural transformations.

* Categorified containers: containers should be *closed under container constructions*.

This may give a structural way to express QIT signatures.

---

### Countable Choice and Cocontinuity

* For branching index ( I = \mathbb{N} ):

  **Countable choice ⇒ cocontinuity in Setoid.**

  If this holds, does it also imply **initiality**?

---

### Emerging Conjecture

* **Intensional choice ⇒ cocontinuity.**
* Cocontinuity is the key step in proving initiality.
* Therefore, a *restricted* form of choice (weaker than WISC) might suffice for many QITs.

---

### Summary of What We Learned

1. Choice principles appear in QIT constructions through **cocontinuity**.
2. WISC may be stronger than necessary; bounded or countable forms of choice might suffice in some cases.
3. Structural conditions (like bounded depth or poset-indexed constructions) may replace global choice.
4. The main open direction is to identify a **precise, syntactic, and constructive alternative to WISC**.
