title: Mobiles as a Quotient-Inductive Type via Plump Ordinals

## Abstract

This note describes a construction of infinitary mobiles as a quotient-inductive type. The construction proceeds in two stages. First, we give a setoid-based description in terms of a transfinite diagram indexed by a plump tree ordinal $(T_I,\le)$. Second, we show that the same construction can be carried out directly in the category **Set**, assuming the availability of non-recursive quotients or colimit higher inductive types.

The key property of the index order $T_I$ is that it possesses a *definable supremum*: every family of elements indexed by $I$ has a canonical upper bound. This avoids the need for WISC (the Weakly Initial Set of Covers), which is typically required to ensure that polynomial functors preserve colimits in exact completions. Our construction is an instance where these general-purpose axioms are unnecessary.

## Setoid Infrastructure

Before presenting the construction, we establish the fundamental categorical infrastructure based on setoids.

### Setoids

A **setoid** $S = (|S|, {\approx_S})$ consists of a set $|S|$ equipped with an equivalence relation ${\approx_S}$ satisfying:

- **Reflexivity**: $x \approx_S x$ for all $x \in |S|$
- **Symmetry**: $x \approx_S y$ implies $y \approx_S x$
- **Transitivity**: $x \approx_S y$ and $y \approx_S z$ implies $x \approx_S z$

Setoids provide a foundation for working with quotient types while maintaining computational content.

### Setoid Homomorphisms

A **setoid homomorphism** $f: S \to T$ is a function $f: |S| \to |T|$ that respects the equivalence relations:

$$x \approx_S y \implies f(x) \approx_T f(y)$$

Setoid homomorphisms compose in the obvious way, and every setoid has an identity homomorphism.

Two homomorphisms $f, g : S \to T$ are **homomorphically equivalent** if for all $x \approx_S y$, we have $f(x) \approx_T g(y)$. This yields an equivalence relation on the hom-sets, making setoids into a category **Setoid**.

### Setoid Isomorphisms

A **setoid isomorphism** $\phi: S \cong T$ consists of setoid homomorphisms $\phi: S \to T$ and $\phi^{-1}: T \to S$ such that:

$$\phi^{-1} \circ \phi \approx \mathrm{id}_S \quad \text{and} \quad \phi \circ \phi^{-1} \approx \mathrm{id}_T$$

where $\approx$ denotes homomorphic equivalence. Setoid isomorphism defines an equivalence relation on setoids.

### Setoid Functors

A **setoid functor** $F: \mathbf{Setoid} \to \mathbf{Setoid}$ assigns to each setoid $S$ a setoid $F(S)$, and to each homomorphism $f: S \to T$ a homomorphism $F(f): F(S) \to F(T)$, satisfying:

- **Identity**: $F(\mathrm{id}_S) \approx \mathrm{id}_{F(S)}$
- **Composition**: $F(g \circ f) \approx F(g) \circ F(f)$
- **Congruence**: $f \approx g$ implies $F(f) \approx F(g)$

These conditions ensure that $F$ is a proper functor on the category of setoids.

## Raw infinitary trees and plumpness

Fix a set $I$. Define the [[W Type]] of infinitary $I$-branching trees:

$$\mathsf{leaf} : T_I, \qquad \mathsf{node} : (I \to T_I) \to T_I.$$

Define the strict plump order $<$ on $T_I$ inductively:

$$u < \mathsf{node}(f) \quad\text{if}\quad u \le f(i) \text{ for some } i.$$

Here $\le$ is the reflexive closure of $<$. Plumpness ensures that for any $f : I \to T_I$, the tree $t^* := \mathsf{node}(f)$ is an upper bound for all $f(i)$:

$$f(i) < t^* \qquad \forall i.$$

## Setoid construction of mobiles

### Stage sets

For each $t : T_I$, define

$$S(t) := \{\,u : T_I \mid u < t\,\}.$$

Define an equivalence relation $\approx$ on $S(t)$ by the following generators:

- $\mathsf{leaf} \approx \mathsf{leaf}$
- if $\forall i,\; f(i)\approx g(i)$ then $\mathsf{node}(f)\approx \mathsf{node}(g)$
- for any bijection $\pi : I \cong I$, if $\forall i,\; f(i)\approx g(\pi(i))$ then both $\mathsf{node}(f)\approx \mathsf{node}(g)$ and $\mathsf{node}(g)\approx \mathsf{node}(f)$

Let $P(t)$ be the setoid whose carrier is $S(t)$ and whose relation is $\approx$.

### The diagram $P$

If $p : t \le u$, then $S(t) \subseteq S(u)$, so we obtain a setoid morphism $P(p) : P(t) \to P(u)$ by inclusion. This yields a diagram

$$P : (T_I,\le) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Setoid}.$$

### The setoid colimit

Define $\mathrm{colim}\,P$ as the quotient of the disjoint union $\sum_{t:T_I} |P(t)|$ by the equivalence generated by:

$$(t,x) \sim (u,P(p)(x)) \qquad\text{for all } p : t\le u.$$

This gives a setoid $(|\mathrm{colim}\,P|,\sim)$ with injections

$$\iota_t : P(t) \longrightarrow \mathrm{colim}\,P.$$

### The quotient-polynomial functor

Define an endofunctor on setoids:

$$\widetilde F_I(X,\approx_X) := \bigl( 1 + (I \to X) \bigr) / \approx_F,$$

where $\approx_F$ is the smallest equivalence relation generated by:

$$\mathsf{Leaf} \approx_F \mathsf{Leaf},$$

$$\mathsf{Node}(f) \approx_F \mathsf{Node}(g) \;\text{if}\; \forall i,\; f(i)\approx_X g(i),$$

$$\mathsf{Node}(f) \approx_F \mathsf{Node}(g) \;\text{if}\; \exists \pi : I\cong I,\ \forall i,\ f(i)\approx_X g(\pi(i)).$$

### Cocontinuity

A crucial lemma is that for any $g : I \to \mathrm{colim}P$, if $g(i)$ is represented by $(t_i,x_i)$ then the definable supremum

$$t^* := \mathsf{node}(i \mapsto t_i)$$

satisfies $t_i \le t^*$, hence

$$g = \iota_{t^*} \circ h$$

for the unique $h : I \to P(t^*)$ defined by $h(i) := P(t_i\le t^*)(x_i)$. This supplies the factorisation needed to prove that $\widetilde F_I$ preserves this colimit.

## Constructing Mobiles Directly in Set

In this section we reinterpret the construction internally in Set, using a colimit higher inductive type. No use of WISC is required because the index order $(T_I,\le)$ has a definable supremum.

### Explicit colimit constructors

Define the colimit as a [[Higher Inductive Type]] $M_I$ with constructors:

**Points:**

$$\mathsf{inc}(t,x) : M_I \qquad (t : T_I,\ x : P(t)).$$

**Paths:**

$$\mathsf{glue}(p,x) : \mathsf{inc}(t,x) = \mathsf{inc}(u, P(p)(x)) \qquad (p : t\le u).$$

No further constructors are required.

### The functor $\widetilde F_I$ on Set

Define

$$\widetilde F_I(X) := \left( 1 + (I \to X) \right) / \approx,$$

where $\approx$ is the same permutation-generated relation as in the setoid case.

### Cocontinuity in Set

Given $g : I \to M_I$, write $g(i)=\mathsf{inc}(t_i,x_i)$. Define $t^* := \mathsf{node}(i \mapsto t_i)$ and

$$h(i) := P(t_i\le t^*)(x_i).$$

Then

$$g(i) = \mathsf{inc}(t^*,h(i))$$

up to paths generated by $\mathsf{glue}$. This provides the factor needed for the $\psi$ map of the cocontinuity equivalence.

### The initial algebra

Cocontinuity yields an isomorphism

$$\widetilde F_I(M_I) \cong \mathrm{Colim}(\widetilde F_I \circ P),$$

from which we obtain a structure map

$$\mathsf{mob}_I : \widetilde F_I(M_I) \to M_I.$$

By transfinite induction along $T_I$ and the colimit universal property, one obtains a unique algebra morphism into any other $\widetilde F_I$-algebra. Hence:

**Theorem.** $M_I$ is the [[Initial Algebra]] for $\widetilde F_I$.

## Remarks on WISC

In general, proving that a polynomial or quotient-polynomial functor preserves colimits in a quotient completion requires a principle such as [[WISC]] to factor arbitrary maps through a small family of covers. In this specific case, the definable supremum provided by the plump order $(T_I,\le)$ replaces the need for any choice principle.
