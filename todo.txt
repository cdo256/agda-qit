Notes (Section 4 only, things you may be missing / worth tightening)

1. **State the cocontinuity goal as a specific isomorphism.**
   In the text, explicitly name the two objects:
   [
   L = \mathrm{colim}*\alpha (F\circ D)*\alpha
   \quad\text{and}\quad
   F(Q)=F(\mathrm{colim}*\alpha D*\alpha),
   ]
   and say “we construct an isomorphism (L \cong F(Q)) by maps (\varphi,\psi)”.

2. **Be explicit about the join/sup operation you use on sizes.**
   Your Agda proof uses operations like (\vee^z) and (\sup(\iota^s n,\mu)).
   In the paper, state minimally: “we assume the size index has joins/sups
   required by polynomial branching”. Cite FPS for this and treat it as black-box.

3. **Clarify precisely where depth preservation is used.**
   In your code, the critical place is the lemma converting colimit equality
   to tight equality ((\approx^l \to \approx^s)), with the step case becoming
   trivial. Make that explicit in prose: it is the reason you can ignore bounds
   when proving (\psi)-congruence.

4. **Check the assumptions on (I).**
   Your Agda module assumes (|I|) (mere inhabitation) to pick an index when
   proving an inequality like (\alpha \le \sup(\ldots)) in the node case.
   Decide whether the paper assumes (I) inhabited. If you only need it for a
   convenience lemma, mention it explicitly; otherwise it will look like hidden
   choice.

5. **Make the dependence on “depth-preserving for all stages” explicit.**
   Your Lemma~\ref{lem:tightening} currently assumes depth preservation for all
   (\alpha). The theorem should either assume depth preservation globally, or
   state and use a lemma “stagewise depth preservation lifts to colimit
   tightening”.

6. **Spell out the equation-satisfaction case in tightening.**
   In Lemma~\ref{lem:tightening} you say “tightened”, but readers will want a
   one-line explanation: “the instantiated lhs and rhs have the same depth by
   Lemma~\ref{lem:mobiles-depth-preserving}, hence can be re-bounded to
   (\mathrm{depth}(s))”.
